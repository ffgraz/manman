This contains the current version of manman. Which is currently
used by Funkfeuer Graz as a simple nodedb.

However the project has been abondend due the lack of manpower and
is far from finished.
We are not planning to work on the codebase as there is much better
software out there which does a better job.

This is repository just exists for documentation purposes.

!Don't use it!
